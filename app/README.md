# DeployGuard App — Deployment Protection Rule

A lightweight webhook server that acts as a GitHub **Custom Deployment Protection Rule**.
When installed on a repository's environment, it automatically evaluates risk and approves
or rejects deployments without any workflow YAML changes.

## How It Works

1. A workflow reaches a job targeting a protected environment (e.g., `production`).
2. GitHub sends a `deployment_protection_rule` webhook to this server.
3. The server fetches the associated PR, scores risk using the **shared risk engine** (`risk-engine.ts`), and responds with `approved` or `rejected`.
4. The deployment proceeds or is blocked based on the response.

## v3 Features

- **Shared risk engine** — uses the same `computeRiskScore` and `decideGate` functions as the Action and MCP server. Scoring is always consistent.
- **Per-environment threshold overrides** — reads `.deployguard.yml` from the repository and applies environment-specific risk/warn thresholds.
- **Deploy outcome webhook** — `/webhook/deploy-outcome` endpoint receives Vercel or generic deployment signals for canary tracking.
- **Service discovery** — `/.well-known/deployguard.json` exposes capabilities for automated integration.
- **Health endpoint** — `GET /health` returns `{ status: "ok" }` for load balancer probes.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                 | Required | Description                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID`          | Yes      | GitHub App ID                                         |
| `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes      | PEM private key (newlines as `\n`)                    |
| `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`  | No       | Webhook secret for HMAC-SHA256 signature verification |
| `RISK_THRESHOLD`         | No       | Block above this score (default: 70)                  |
| `WARN_THRESHOLD`         | No       | Warn above this score (default: 55)                   |
| `CANARY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`  | No       | HMAC secret for deploy outcome webhook verification   |
| `PORT`                   | No       | Server port (default: 3000)                           |

## Setup

### Deploy

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Start
npm start

# Development (with hot reload)
npm run dev
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t deployguard-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env deployguard-app
```

### Register the GitHub App

1. Create a GitHub App with **Repository permissions**:
   - Actions: read
   - Deployments: read + write
   - Contents: read (for `.deployguard.yml`)
2. Subscribe to the `deployment_protection_rule` event
3. Set the webhook URL to `https://your-host/webhook`
4. Install the app on your repository
5. In the repository's environment settings, enable the app as a protection rule

## Per-Environment Overrides

The app reads `.deployguard.yml` from the repository at evaluation time. Environment-specific thresholds override the defaults:

```yaml
environments:
  production:
    risk: 50
    warn: 35
  staging:
    risk: 80
    warn: 60
```

When a deployment targets `production`, the app uses `risk: 50` instead of the default `70`.
